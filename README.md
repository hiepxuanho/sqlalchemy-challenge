# Hawaii Climate Analysis

This project is designed to help plan a holiday trip to Hawaii, by providing climate insights through data analysis. We’ll use Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform a comprehensive analysis of precipitation and temperature trends for the area.

# Project Overview
This project performs a climate analysis and data exploration of Honolulu’s climate using an SQLite database. The analysis consists of:

1. Precipitation Analysis - Analyzing precipitation patterns over a specific period.
2. Station Analysis - Analyzing temperature trends and activity levels of different weather stations.

# Files Included
- climate_starter.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to execute and visualize the analysis.
- hawaii.sqlite: SQLite database containing climate data.
